  <hr/>
  <pre>Untill my 12 class i really didnt do any projects. I really start to do projests when i started my bachleor education.The projects which I did are listed as follows=
    1=<b>automatic line following and wall following car using ir sensosor and ultrasonic sensor</b>
    <a href="https://github.com/sumit123hub/line-following-and-wall-following-car/blob/main/car">my github link for code of my car</a>
    This was our first project from robotics club of paschimanchal when we entered first semester.It was quite hard at first since i didnt have knowledge at such things but slowly it became clear and we finally completed our project.
